Goals: Analyze both active treatment and after-care treatment of stroke patients in Estonia. Compare different types of rehabilitation both regionally and overall. Use machine learning to predict the chances of healing of a patient. 

Concepts: There is a introductory pdf file about our project in the main branch and 5 CSV files (some cleaned up by us) and a notebook file of our final project in the master branch.
