Goals: Analyze both active treatment and after-care treatment of stroke patients in Estonia. Compare different types of rehabilitation both regionally and overall. Use machine learning to predict the chances of healing of a patient. 

Concepts: There is a introductory pdf file about our project in the main branch and 5 CSV files (some cleaned up by us) and a notebook file of our final project in the master branch. In main branch we have 2 PDF files, out of which the D5_project_final is the most correct one. When we submitted the first one, we did not have all the data due to privacy protocols by the hospital.

Use: We used Deepnote to create our project but before uploading everything to Github, changed the filepaths and code so that the project works when all of the files are in the same folder.
